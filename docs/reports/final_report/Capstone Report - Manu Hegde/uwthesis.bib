This chapter is meant as a practical guide with recommendations for some of the most commonly used hyperparameters, in particular in the context of learning algorithms based on back-propagated gradient and gradient-based optimization. It also discusses how to deal with the fact that more interesting results can be obtained when allowing one to adjust many hyper-parameters. Overall, it describes elements of the practice used to successfully and efficiently train and debug large-scale and often deep multi-layer neural networks.

Fluids are well described by the Navier-Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10× finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.},

Traditional physics-based models are sample efficient, and interpretable but often rely on rigid assumptions. Furthermore, direct numerical approximation is usually computationally intensive, requiring significant computational resources and expertise, and many real-world systems do not have fully-known governing laws. While deep learning (DL) provides novel alternatives for efficiently recognizing complex patterns and emulating nonlinear dynamics, its predictions do not necessarily obey the governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize well across different systems. Thus, the study of physics-guided DL emerged and has gained great progress. Physics-guided DL aims to take the best from both physics-based modeling and state-of-the-art DL models to better solve scientific problems. In this paper, we provide a structured overview of existing methodologies of integrating prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into DL, with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems.

Our experiments show that the generator is able to infer more realistic high-resolution details by using additional physical quantities, such as low-resolution velocities or vorticities. Besides improvements in the training process and in the generated outputs, these inputs offer means for artistic control as well. We additionally employ a physics-aware data augmentation step, which is crucial to avoid overfitting and to reduce memory requirements. In this way, our network learns to generate advected quantities with highly detailed, realistic, and temporally coherent features. Our method works instantaneously, using only a single time-step of low-resolution fluid data.

These machine-learning models are applied to two-dimensional cylinder wake as a preliminary test and show remarkable ability to reconstruct laminar flow from low-resolution flow field data. We further assess the performance of these models for two-dimensional homogeneous turbulence. The CNN and DSC/MS models are found to reconstruct turbulent flows from extremely coarse flow field images with remarkable accuracy. For the turbulent flow problem, the machine-leaning based super-resolution analysis can greatly enhance the spatial resolution with as little as 50 training snapshot data, holding great potential to reveal subgrid-scale physics of complex turbulent flows.

By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

We propose a deep probabilistic-neural-network architecture for learning a minimal and near-orthogonal set of non-linear modes from high-fidelity turbulent-flow data useful for flow analysis, reduced-order modeling and flow control. Our approach is based on β-variational autoencoders (β-VAEs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which enable extracting non-linear modes from multi-scale turbulent flows while encouraging the learning of independent latent variables and penalizing the size of the latent vector. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm for ordering VAE-based modes with respect to their contribution to the reconstruction. We apply this method for non-linear mode decomposition of the turbulent flow through a simplified urban environment, where the flow-field data is obtained based on well-resolved large-eddy simulations (LESs). We demonstrate that by constraining the shape of the latent space, it is possible to motivate the orthogonality and extract a set of parsimonious modes sufficient for high-quality reconstruction. Our results show the excellent performance of the method in the reconstruction against linear-theory-based decompositions, where the energy percentage captured by the proposed method from five modes is equal to 87.36\% against 32.41\% of the POD. Moreover, we compare our method with available AE-based models. We show the ability of our approach in the extraction of near-orthogonal modes with the determinant of the correlation matrix equal to 0.99, which may lead to interpretability.},

The \${\textbackslash}beta\$-VAE is trained to learn a compact latent representation of the flow velocity, and the transformer is trained to predict the temporal dynamics in latent space. Using the \${\textbackslash}beta\$-VAE to learn disentangled representations in latent-space, we obtain a more interpretable flow model with features that resemble those observed in the proper orthogonal decomposition, but with a more efficient representation.

In this study, we propose a method that combines β-VAEs for modal decomposition and transformer neural networks for temporal-dynamics prediction in the latent space to develop ROMs. We apply our method to an existing database of a turbulent flow around a wall-mounted square cylinder obtained by direct numerical simulation (DNS). A parametric study is performed to investigate the effects of the hyperparameters of the proposed β-VAEs and determine the optimal values. For the first time, we incorporate the consideration of the complexity of architecture into our studies, providing new insights into hyperparameter selection for β-VAEs, which remains a challenging problem for optimising model performance. Results regarding the influence of the different hyperparameters and guidelines to design these architectures are reported. Our optimal model achieves a reconstruction accuracy of 97.18\% of the entire dataset using only ten modes. Subsequently, we employ the transformer models to identify latent-space temporal dynamics learned by the optimal β-VAE model and build ROMs to predict instantaneous fields. The resulting model achieves promising accuracy in temporal-dynamics predictions and yields energy reconstruction levels of 96.5\% and 83\% for a field 25 and 50 steps into the future, respectively, showcasing the potential of the transformer in predicting the temporal dynamics. Overall, the proposed method has potential applications in advanced flow control and fundamental studies of complex turbulent flows.},

This representation is decoded using single or multiple decoder LSTMs to perform different tasks, such as reconstructing the input sequence, or predicting the future sequence. We experiment with two kinds of input sequences - patches of image pixels and high-level representations ("percepts") of video frames extracted using a pretrained convolutional net. We explore different design choices such as whether the decoder LSTMs should condition on the generated output. We analyze the outputs of the model qualitatively to see how well the model can extrapolate the learned video representation into the future and into the past. We further evaluate the representations by finetuning them for a supervised learning problem - human action recognition on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. We show that the representations help improve classification accuracy, especially when there are only few training examples. Even models pretrained on unrelated datasets (300 hours of YouTube videos) can help action recognition performance.},

	abstract = {As a substantial amount of multivariate time series data is being produced by the complex systems in Smart Manufacturing, improved anomaly detection frameworks are needed to reduce the operational risks and the monitoring burden placed on the system operators. However, building such frameworks is challenging, as a sufficiently large amount of defective training data is often not available and frameworks are required to capture both the temporal and contextual dependencies across different time steps while being robust to noise. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Attention-based Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Autoencoder with Dynamic Thresholding (ACLAE-DT) framework for anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series. The framework starts by pre-processing and enriching the data, before constructing feature images to characterize the system statuses across different time steps by capturing the inter-correlations between pairs of time series. Afterwards, the constructed feature images are fed into an attention-based ConvLSTM autoencoder, which aims to encode the constructed feature images and capture the temporal behavior, followed by decoding the compressed knowledge representation to reconstruct the feature images input. The reconstruction errors are then computed and subjected to a statistical-based, dynamic thresholding mechanism to detect and diagnose the anomalies. Evaluation results conducted on real-life manufacturing data demonstrate the performance strengths of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods under different experimental settings.},

Further, AE-ConvLSTM was used in an effort to predict the time evolution of two unsteady Navier-Stokes problems. These problems have coupled pressure and velocity field having different magnitude order, and these fields evolve in time at a different rate.

The rising popularity of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques like direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) have made significant inroads into the problem. However, they remain out of reach for many practical three-dimensional flows characterized by extremely large domains and transient phenomena. Therefore designing efficient and accurate data-driven generative approaches to model turbulence is a necessity. We propose a novel training approach for dimensionality reduction and spatio-temporal modeling of the three-dimensional dynamics of turbulence using a combination of Convolutional autoencoder and the Convolutional LSTM neural networks. The quality of the emulated turbulent fields is assessed with rigorous physics-based statistical tests, instead of visual assessments. The results show significant promise in the training methodology to generate physically consistent turbulent flows at a small fraction of the computing resources required for DNS.},

The calculation, however, suffers from a massive amount of computing resources. A predictive model, to reduce the computing cost and accelerate the calculations, is proposed in this work. By employing an artificial neural network, composed of convolution layers and convolution long short-term memory layers, the model is an equivalent substitution of multiple time steps. A physical informed training loss function is introduced to improve the model predictive accuracy; and for the two-dimensional driven cavity problem, the mean square error of the prediction is less than 1.5×10−6. For non-stationary flow, a time-dependent computing structure based on the current model is established. Nine iterative model calculations are performed consecutively for a two-dimensional driven cavity model, and the results are validated by comparing with the original (serial) lattice Boltzmann algorithm. Generally, in the case of training Reynolds number, for velocity and speed, the mean and the maximum absolute errors are lower than 0.012 and 0.12. Similarly, in the generalizing case, the mean and the maximum absolute errors are lower than 0.017 and 0.012. Besides, the current model's efficiency is about 15 times higher than that of the original lattice Boltzmann method.},

The present ML-ROM is constructed by two ML schemes: a convolutional neural network-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) and a long short-term memory (LSTM). The CNN-AE is utilized to map high-dimensional flow fields obtained by direct numerical simulation (DNS) into a low-dimensional latent space while keeping their spatially coherent information. The LSTM is then trained to learn the temporal evolution of the mapped latent vectors together with the information on the Reynolds number. Using the trained LSTM model, the high-dimensional dynamics of flow fields can be reproduced with the aid of the decoder part of CNN-AE, which can map the predicted low-dimensional latent vector to the high-dimensional space. We find that the flow fields generated by the present ML-ROM show statistical agreement with the reference DNS data. The dependence of the accuracy of the proposed model on the Reynolds number is also examined in detail. The present results demonstrate that the ML-ROM can reconstruct flows at the Reynolds numbers that were not used in the training process unless the flow regime drastically changes.},

	abstract = {The Poisson equation is present in very different domains of physics and engineering. In most cases, this equation can not be solved directly and iterative solvers are used. For many solvers, this step is computationally intensive. In this study, an alternative resolution method based on neural networks is evaluated for incompressible flows. A fluid solver coupled with a Convolutional Neural Network is developed and trained on random cases with constant density to predict the pressure field. Its performance is tested in a plume configuration, with different buoyancy forces, parametrized by the Richardson number. The neural network is compared to a traditional Jacobi solver. The performance improvement is considerable, although the accuracy of the network is found to depend on the flow operating point: low errors are obtained at low Richardson numbers, whereas the fluid solver becomes unstable with large errors for large Richardson number. Finally, a hybrid strategy is proposed in order to benefit from the calculation acceleration while ensuring a user-defined accuracy level. In particular, this hybrid CFD-NN strategy, by maintaining the desired accuracy whatever the flow condition, makes the code stable and reliable even at large Richardson numbers for which the network was not trained for. This study demonstrates the capability of the hybrid approach to tackle new flow physics, unseen during the network training.},

In the present work, we propose a novel fully convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to infer the solution of the Poisson equation on a 2D Cartesian grid with different resolutions given the right-hand side term, arbitrary boundary conditions, and grid parameters. It provides unprecedented versatility for a CNN approach dealing with partial differential equations. The boundary conditions are handled using a novel approach by decomposing the original Poisson problem into a homogeneous Poisson problem plus four inhomogeneous Laplace subproblems. The model is trained using a novel loss function approximating the continuous  norm between the prediction and the target. Even when predicting on grids denser than previously encountered, our model demonstrates encouraging capacity to reproduce the correct solution profile. The proposed model, which outperforms well-known neural network models, can be included in a CFD solver to help with solving the Poisson equation. Analytical test cases indicate that our CNN architecture is capable of predicting the correct solution of a Poisson problem with mean percentage errors below 10\%, an improvement by comparison to the first step of conventional iterative methods. Predictions from our model, used as the initial guess to iterative algorithms like Multigrid, can reduce the root mean square error after a single iteration by more than 90\% compared to a zero initial guess.},

Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are successful machine-learning methods for the solution and identification of partial differential equations. We employ PINNs for solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible turbulent flows without any specific model or assumption for turbulence and by taking only the data on the domain boundaries. We first show the applicability of PINNs for solving the Navier–Stokes equations for laminar flows by solving the Falkner–Skan boundary layer. We then apply PINNs for the simulation of four turbulent-flow cases, i.e., zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layer, and turbulent flows over a NACA4412 airfoil and the periodic hill. Our results show the excellent applicability of PINNs for laminar flows with strong pressure gradients, where predictions with less than 1\% error can be obtained. For turbulent flows, we also obtain very good accuracy on simulation results even for the Reynolds-stress components.},

	abstract = {The historical development of NACA airfoils is briefly reviewed. New data are presented that permit the rapid calculation of the approximate pressure distributions for the older NACA four-digit and five-digit airfoils by the same methods used for the NACA 6-series airfoils. The general methods used to derive the basic thickness forms for NACA 6 and 7-series airfoils together with their corresponding pressure distributions are presented. Detail data necessary for the application of the airfoils to wing design are presented in supplementary figures placed at the end of the paper. The report includes an analysis of the lift, drag, pitching-moment, and critical-speed characteristics of the airfoils, together with a discussion of the effects of surface conditions. Available data on high-lift devices are presented. Problems associated with lateral-control devices, leading-edge air intakes, and interference are briefly discussed, together with aerodynamic problems of application.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, deep learning (DL)-based video surveillance services are widely used in smart cities because of their ability to accurately identify and track objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians, in real time. This allows a more efficient traffic management and improved public safety. However, DL-based video surveillance services that require object movement and motion tracking (e.g., for detecting abnormal object behaviors) can consume a substantial amount of computing and memory capacity, such as (i) GPU computing resources for model inference and (ii) GPU memory resources for model loading. This paper presents a novel cognitive video surveillance management with long short-term memory (LSTM) model, denoted as the CogVSM framework. We consider DL-based video surveillance services in a hierarchical edge computing system. The proposed CogVSM forecasts object appearance patterns and smooths out the forecast results needed for an adaptive model release. Here, we aim to reduce standby GPU memory by model release while avoiding unnecessary model reloads for a sudden object appearance. CogVSM hinges on an LSTM-based deep learning architecture explicitly designed for future object appearance pattern prediction by training previous time-series patterns to achieve these objectives. By referring to the result of the LSTM-based prediction, the proposed framework controls the threshold time value in a dynamic manner by using an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) technique. Comparative evaluations on both simulated and real-world measurement data on the commercial edge devices prove that the LSTM-based model in the CogVSM can achieve a high predictive accuracy, i.e., a root-mean-square error metric of 0.795. In addition, the suggested framework utilizes up to 32.1\% less GPU memory than the baseline and 8.9\% less than previous work.},
