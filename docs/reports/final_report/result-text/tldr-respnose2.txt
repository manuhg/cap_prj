To generate prime numbers, you start with a list of all the numbers up to a certain number (in this case, max). Then, you cross off all the multiples of each prime number you find. This process continues until you've crossed off all the multiples of all the prime numbers you've found. The remaining numbers in the list are the prime numbers.Here's a step-by-step guide:1. Create a list of all the numbers up to max.2. Cross off all the multiples of each prime number you find.3. Continue this process until you've crossed off all the multiples of all the prime numbers you've found.Note: You can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to max.
