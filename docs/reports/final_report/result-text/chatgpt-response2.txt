To generate prime numbers, Cracking the Coding Interview outlines two primary methods: trial division and the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Trial division checks whether a number is divisible by any integer up to its square root and is suitable for verifying if a single number is prime. For generating multiple primes efficiently, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is recommended; it initializes a boolean array representing numbers up to a limit and iteratively marks multiples of each prime as non-prime, resulting in an array of prime indicators. This sieve approach offers better performance with a time complexity of O(n log log n), making it ideal for generating large sets of prime numbers.
