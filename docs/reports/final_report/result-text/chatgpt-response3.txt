Caching, as described in System Design Interview: An Insiderâ€™s Guide and Cracking the Coding Interview, is a technique used to temporarily store frequently accessed or computationally expensive data in fast-access memory (typically RAM) to improve system performance and reduce load on backend systems like databases. It acts as an intermediary layer between clients and data stores, allowing applications to first check the cache for data before querying the database. Common strategies include read-through caching, expiration policies, and eviction methods like Least Recently Used (LRU), with considerations for consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability.
