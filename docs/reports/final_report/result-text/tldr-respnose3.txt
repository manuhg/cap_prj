Caching is a technique used to improve the performance of an application by storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area, called the cache. This allows the application to retrieve the data quickly, reducing the load on the database or data store. Caching can be used to improve the performance of web applications, database applications, and even mobile applications. It is a technique that can be used to mitigate the problem of the "cold start" problem, where the application has to wait for the data to be retrieved from the database or data store. Caching can be implemented in various ways, including the use of caching tiers, caching strategies, and caching APIs.
